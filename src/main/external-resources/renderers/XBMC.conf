# TranscodedVideoFileSize: The amount of transcoded data is unknown at the
# time of transcoding. Still, some renderers expect a size for the video file
# to be returned. Possible values are:
#            0: No size is sent to the renderer (default value)
# 100000000000: Fake size of 100 GB is sent to the renderer.
#           -1: Specific value that works perfect for the PS3. It is against
#               the DLNA spec though.
#
# if inserted, an arbitrary length is sent as content-length, which may be much too high. Thus, the renderer expects too many bytes. "Sent to socket: Content-Length: xxxx"

# SUPPORTED MEDIA FORMATS
#
# This section defines which media formats are supported by this renderer. If
# a file is supported and its mediainfo indicates that it falls within the
# capabilities of this renderer, PMS will stream the file to the renderer. All
# other files will be transcoded before being sent to the renderer.
#
# Each format that the renderer supports should result in a "Supported" line
# that defines the capabilities of the renderer. When MediaInfo = true, media
# files are parsed and their properties are matched against all "Supported"
# lines. If a value for a specific property cannot be parsed, that property
# is assumed to match.
#
# The order of the "Supported" lines matters: when multiple lines match, the
# first match is used.
#
# The media parser and this configuration file will recognize the following
# formats and codecs. Use lower case names only, regular expressions are
# supported. These are chosen from the most commonly used supported formats
# and codecs:
#
#        mpegps             (MPEG presentation stream, used in DVD Videos, VCDs, etc.)
#        mpegts             (MPEG transport stream, used in sat TV, Blu-rays, etc.)

#
# Each of the "Supported" lines contains the following parameters separated by
# spaces or tabs:
#
#    f:    Regular expression to match the format of a file as parsed by the
#          MediaInfo library (see the list above). This parameter is mandatory.
#          Be careful when matching everything with ".+", the renderer must be
#          able to handle all formats.
#
#    v:    Regular expression to match the video codec of the file as parsed by
#          the MediaInfo library (see the list above).
#
#    a:    Regular expression to match the audio codec of the file as parsed by
#          the MediaInfo library (see the list above).
#
#    m:    The mime type to send to the renderer. Use of this parameter is
#          strongly recommended. If it is not set, an estimated value will be
#          assigned.
#
#    n:    The maximum number of audio channels used in the file as parsed by
#          the MediaInfo library.
#
#    s:    The maximum audio sample frequency used in the file as parsed by
#          the MediaInfo library, specified in Hertz.
#
#    b:    The maximum audio bit rate used in the file as parsed by the
#          MediaInfo library, specified in bits per second.
#
#    w:    The maximum video width used in the file as parsed by the MediaInfo
#          library, specified in pixels.
#
#    h:    The maximum video height used in the file as parsed by the MediaInfo
#          library, specified in pixels.
#
#    qpel: Quarter pixel codec setting in the file as parsed by the MediaInfo
#          library.
#
#    gmc:  The number of global motion compensation warp points in the file as
#          parsed by the MediaInfo library.
